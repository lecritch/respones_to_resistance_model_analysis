- help with how to deal with use of force
- fsm using subset of features
- how best to deal with figuring out whether citizen was injured at an incident, rather than by each officer at the incident
- need to brain storm my audience and thus my metric
- still having trouble with my 'business' case and who and what this helps... after working with the data, I'm thinking this is meaningless and losing confidence :/ 
- one thing I may have overlooked is that this dataset is on response to resistance which... wouldn't you expect force if someone is trying to resist arrest?  This dataset
isn't just someone being randomly pulled up and then hurt by police... it's in an encounter where someone has been charged and is trying to be arrested and they've resisted. 
Of course these arrests could be unjust but I'm not sure I can determine that from this data...
