    "\n",
    "- objectid:  this appears to be the incident ID and should be unique (check this).  This is probably the identifier of the dataset\n",
    "- zip:  zip code of the incident - currently a float, should probably change to integer\n",
    "- filenum:  the file number of the incident that is recorded in official police records - check this and make sure it aligns with police records (should be able to look file numbers up...)\n",
    "- uofnum:  UOF should stand for 'Use of Force'.  The use of force number probably refers to an id number relating to the type of force used.  Should check that uofnum and forcetype match up. \n",
    "- occurred_d:  Date the incident occured.  Change to datetime object\n",
    "- occured_t:  time the incident occured.  Change to datetime object\n",

    "- off_hospit:  I think this is whether the officer had to go to hospital or not - check this\n",
    "- service_ty:  I'm not sure what this is exactly but it looks like it is what type of service the officer performed during the incident or what it was labelled as when the officer was called to the scene.  e.g. were they performing an arrest, were they off duty and witnessed a crime, were they attending a service call etc\n",
    "- forcetype:  This details what type of force was used on the citizen\n",
    "- street_n:  The street number of the incident\n",

    "- council district:  The ID of the coucil district of the incident\n",
    "- ra:  Not sure what RA is - look this up\n",
    "- beat:  The police beat in which the incident occured?  Or is this the police beat from which the officers are from?\n",
    "- sector:  The police sector?  Or the county section?  Check this\n",
    "- division:  I think this relates to county info?  But could be more police sector info?  Check this - is it even needed?\n",
    "- x:  Coordinates of the incident?  Not sure...\n",

So, we need to isolate the data down to incidents, and discover whether the citizen was injured.  Since a row represents 1 officer, the officer injured statistics above should be correct, but we will need to adjust things to account for the citizen being injured.
